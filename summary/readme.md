## data and metadata quality tests - a summary

Large dense seismic networks popping up around the world in the last two decades enable studying the wave propagation and structure of the Earth with unprecedented details. Hundreds of broadband seismic stations spaced by tens of kilometers produce large amounts of data, which is usually processed by automatic routines. The data is no longer supervised by seismologists on a detailed level of every record as thousands of hours of data are handled at once.
	Ensuring the quality of data and accompanying metadata is nowadays a discipline by and of itself. Besides the classical techniques, which investigate the properties of data at a single station, large dense seismic networks allow for a multi-station approach to review the quality of the data. The diagnostic tools of multi-station methods are based on the detection of outlying stations/records among many others. Properties of the wavefield of wavelengths longer than the station spacing vary smoothly and hence comparing the measurement at neighboring stations allows for identifying anomalous behaviors. These methods work under the assumption that most of the (meta-) data is correct, and therefore a small number of outliers can be detected. Thus, not only do large dense seismic networks contribute to research, which is their primary goal, but thanks to the design of these networks, data quality can also be tested more precisely than before. Here we introduce also a summarizing table, where the results of all tests are homogeneously presented so that each particular seismic stations can be easily checked for all the tested properties. The purpose of these tests is aimed in both directions: towards the users, so that they are aware of potential issues, as well as towards the station and network operators so that they can be notified and asked to fix the detected problems. 

## particular tests
### Johannes - availability and retrievability
Detailed description of the tests performed by Johannes is available at [Johannes' GitHub](https://github.com/doukutsu/eida-data-monitoring/)
with the [maps](https://github.com/doukutsu/eida-data-monitoring/tree/main/months) showing the results of data retrievability for the AdriaArray region by months.

### Luděk - formal StationXML checks
Luděk performs detailed formal tests of the metadata, see the [description](https://github.com/PetrColinSky/DataQuality/tree/master/ludekvecsey) and [tables listing the issues](https://github.com/PetrColinSky/DataQuality/tree/master/ludekvecsey/REPORTS). Overview is given also in the [slides from the Sofia workshop](https://github.com/PetrColinSky/DataQuality/blob/master/ludekvecsey/Talk_Vecsey_MetadataQC.pdf).

### Felix - noise maps
Overview of the methodology is available at [Felix' GitHub](https://github.com/felix-eckel/AdriaArrayQC). You can also check directly the [maps of noise levels](https://github.com/felix-eckel/AdriaArrayQC/tree/main/noise_maps).

### Petr - earthquake data quality
Description of the testing procedure is here at [Petr's GitHub](https://github.com/PetrColinSky/DataQuality/tree/master/petrkolinsky). The results are shown in [maps](https://github.com/PetrColinSky/DataQuality/tree/master/petrkolinsky/maps). There are also [plots of earthquake records](https://github.com/PetrColinSky/DataQuality/tree/master/petrkolinsky/plots).

## the table
Different tests are performed using different codes and by different researchers. To easily see the performance of a given station, the results of the tests are summarized in an a table coded by Tena Belinić Topić. Every row corresponds to one station. The outputs of the individual tests are sorted by respective stations and aligned in the table by the station name. Every column then shows the result of a particular test. This table does not replace the detailed results of the individual tests, which are sometimes testing separate channels, or give more values on the output than can be implemented in a simple table. The table serves as a teaser for pointing the users and the station/network operators to the particular tests to find out, what exactly is the issue reported at their station of interest. Whenever a new test is performed, the table can be easily updated, either by replacing previous test, or by adding the new test to the right side of the table. The particular tests as well as the summary table were presented at [EGU 2024 poster](https://github.com/PetrColinSky/DataQuality/blob/master/summary/EGU24poster_Kolinsky.pdf).

The table lists 2009 stations in the moment and focuses on the AdriaArray region. We plan to add more stations in the future. The retrievability tests (Johannes) are shown for every month of the AdriaArray operational period since June 2022. Eight columns for each month correspond to the BH and HH channels for four parameters: WFCatalog availability, FDSNWS availability, metadata issue and retrievability. On the right side, three columns show the noise test (Felix) results for the three frequency bands, two other columns show the IRIS validator and corner period test (Luděk) and the last two columns are for the earthquake data quality tests (Petr). White cell means the given parameter was not tested for the particular station. Green means positive results, red is negative, yellow is intermediate or warning.
